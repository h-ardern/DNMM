# DNMM - Dense-Net MetaMax

This is the final version of the source code used in training my final year project.
Im in the process of tidying up the code and rewrighting it in pytorch as its more stable than tensorflow.

The projects goal was the creation of a Open Learnign baced D.C.N.N. that could provide a new novel approach of NIDS (Network Intrution Detection).
